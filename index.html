            <div id="article">
                <p> Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus. The story of how this happened is told <br>
                    in part of the Bible known as the Gospels. There are four Gospels telling the life of Jesus. <br>
                    The Gospel of Luke tells the most about his birth, and the Gospel of Matthew tells another <br>
                    part of the story. The Gospel of John says that Jesus came from God to bring his "Word" or <br>
                    message to all people.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> The Gospels say that many years before Jesus' birth, prophets had told a promise to the <br>
                    Jewish people that God would send them a Messiah, or holy teacher. Christians believe that <br>
                     the promised Messiah was Jesus. His mother was a young woman called Mary, who was engaged, <br>
                      but not yet married to a carpenter called Joseph. Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant <br>
                       and was upset. He was wondering what he should do, when an angel came from God to tell <br>
                       him that the baby was the Holy One. The angel said that he must name the baby. This was <br>
                        a sign that he would take care of it like his own child.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    All these parts of the Christmas story are remembered and celebrated in different ways at <br>
                    Christmas: in pictures, songs, plays, stories and in models that are called "cribs", <br>
                     "creches" or "presepe".
